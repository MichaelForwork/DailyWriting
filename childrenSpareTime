Extracurricular activities are the kind of experience that could have a formative impact on children.
Some educators argue that young kids should be given permission to decide how to spend their spare time after school.
I think this is a smart move.

To begin with, after-school activities are supposed to be fun and they wouldn't  make any sence unless children are to decide
on their own.
When schoolwork has already put much strain on kids, they would easily burn out if they are deprived of the right to do what
they want.
Some may argue that school-related activities and sports events can also serve as a way to release stress, but let's face it,
it is next to impossible to cater to all needs.

When I was a kid, I was a huge fan of classical music, but instead of taking me to concerts, my folks gave me a soccer and 
sent me to tryouts.
It was a nightmare.
I couldn't sleep at night, feeling so tense and stressed up.
Even up to now, it still gives me creeps when I'm reminded of this experience.
